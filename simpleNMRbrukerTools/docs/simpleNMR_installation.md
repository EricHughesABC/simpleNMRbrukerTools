### 1. Overview

This guide goes through in detail how to install the simpleNMR tools into Topspin. SimpleNMR uses the python 3 environment installed in Topspin.  The guide was written for versions of Topspin 4.5.0 and above. On Windows a python 3 environment is installed automatically, on macOs, the user has to install a python environmnent or provide a path to a locally installed python 3 environment. Please read the official Topspin user guides first to get an overview on how python 3 runs within Topspin, especially  ***Python 3 API Jupyter Notebook***. This guide shows how to install a python 3 environment for macOs and install the Topspin python modules.

In this guide, this installation process will also be outlined again.



### 7. Add simpleNMR to Topspin flowbar

Although the tools in simpleNMR could be ran on the command line using the command xpy3 simpleNMRtool, they can also be installed as a flowbar into the Topspin interface. This is a simple process.
